- Latest Fidelity balances and positions
- Domain knowledge via auto-activated skills

**Token efficiency**: With all Finance Guru context loaded, you still have **51% of your 200k context window free** for actual analysis work.

### 🔧 9 Finance Guru Skills

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture

- Sensitive files protected by comprehensive .gitignore
- No external data transmission without explicit user action
- Pull upstream updates without touching your private configs

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

Quality gates ensure reliability:

- Unit tests for all calculator classes
- CLI integration tests
- Hook functionality tests (Bun-based)
- Gitignore protection tests
- Full setup flow integration tests
- Onboarding resume and idempotent re-run tests
