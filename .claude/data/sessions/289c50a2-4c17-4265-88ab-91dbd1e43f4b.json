Download from: https://go.dev/dl/ and the $GOPATH is set then:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mop-tracker/mop\ncd mop\ngo build ./cmd/mop\n./mop\n```\n\n### Using mop\nBy default, mop refreshes quotes and market data on a 5 minute (600s) interval.  These values can be changed in the .moprc file.\n\nFor demonstration purposes mop comes preconfigured with a number of stock tickers. You can easily change the default list by using the following keyboard commands:\n\n```\n   +                  Add stocks to list\n   -                  Remove stocks from list\n   ? h H              Display this help screen\n   f                  Set filtering expression\n   F                  Unset filtering expression\n   g G                Group stocks by advancing/declining issues\n   o                  Change column sort order\n   p P                Pause market data and stock updates\n   t                  Toggle timestamp on/off\n   Mouse Scroll       Scroll up/down\n   PgUp/PgDn          Scroll up/down\n   Up/Down arrows     Scroll up\n   j J                Scroll up\n   k K                Scroll down\n   q esc              Quit mop\n```\n\nWhen prompted please enter comma-delimited list of stock tickers.\n\nThe list and other settings are stored in the profile file (default: ``.moprc`` in your ``$HOME`` directory).\n\n### No Timestamp\n![image](https://github.com/mop-tracker/mop/assets/12674437/f753ce40-c9b2-4ed1-bf51-2a79c83f3f1c)\n\n### With Timestamp\n![image](https://github.com/mop-tracker/mop/assets/12674437/8d732111-d25a-425f-bdbf-f0ada6e04b75)\n\n### Expression-based Filtering\nMop has an in realtime expression-based filtering engine that is very easy to use.\n\nAt the main screen, press `f` and a prompt will appear. Write an expression that uses the stock properties.\n\nExample:\n\n```last <= 5```\n\nThis expression will make Mop show only the stocks whose `last` values are less than $5.\n\nThe available properties are: `last`, `change`, `changePercent`, `open`, `low`, `high`, `low52`, `high52`, `volume`, `avgVolume`, `pe`, `peX`, `dividend`, `yield`, `mktCap`, `mktCapX` and `advancing`.\n\nThe expression **must** return a boolean value, otherwise it will fail.\n\nFor detailed information about the syntax, please refer to [Knetic/govaluate#what-operators-and-types-does-this-support](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate#what-operators-and-types-does-this-support).\n\nTo clear the filter, press `Shift+F`.\n\nYou can specify the profile you want to use by passing ``-profile <filename>`` to the command-line.\n\n### Options and settings\n\nIn `~/.moprc`:\n\n```\n    \"RowShading\": true,\n```\n\nwill cause row shading on alternate lines.\n\n### Contributing\n* Pull requests accepted.\n\n### License\nCopyright (c) 2013-2024 by Michael Dvorkin and contributors.
