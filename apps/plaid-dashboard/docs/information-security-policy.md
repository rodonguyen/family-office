This policy applies to:

- All Finance Guru application components and infrastructure
- All data processed, stored, or transmitted by the application
- All development, deployment, and operational procedures
- Third-party integrations (Plaid, hosting providers, etc.)

## 3. Security Governance

### 3.1 Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Policy Owner | Maintain policy, conduct reviews, approve changes |
| Development Team | Implement security controls, secure coding practices |
| Operations | Monitor systems, respond to incidents, maintain infrastructure |

### 3.2 Policy Review Cycle

- **Quarterly:** Security control effectiveness review
- **Semi-annually:** Full policy review and update
- **Annually:** Third-party security assessment
- **Ad-hoc:** Following security incidents or significant changes

---

## 4. Risk Identification

### 4.1 Risk Assessment Process

Finance Guru conducts ongoing risk identification through:

1. **Threat Modeling**
   - Identify assets (user data, credentials, tokens)
   - Identify threat actors (external attackers, insider threats)
   - Map attack vectors (API abuse, injection, credential theft)
   - Document in threat model registry

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Automated dependency scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
   - Static code analysis on each commit
   - Dynamic application security testing (DAST) monthly

3. **Third-Party Risk Assessment**
   - Evaluate security posture of integrations (Plaid, hosting)
   - Review SOC 2 reports and security certifications
   - Monitor vendor security advisories

### 4.2 Risk Registry

All identified risks are documented in a risk registry containing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Risk ID | Unique identifier |
| Description | Nature of the risk |
| Likelihood | Low / Medium / High |
| Impact | Low / Medium / High / Critical |
| Risk Score | Likelihood × Impact |
| Mitigation Status | Open / In Progress / Mitigated / Accepted |
| Owner | Responsible party |
| Review Date | Next review date |

### 4.3 Key Risk Categories

1. **Data Breach** - Unauthorized access to financial data
2. **Token Compromise** - Plaid access token exposure
3. **Injection Attacks** - SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS
4. **Authentication Bypass** - Unauthorized account access
5. **API Abuse** - Rate limiting, unauthorized endpoints
6. **Supply Chain** - Compromised dependencies

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation Controls

### 5.1 Technical Controls

#### Authentication & Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- Session management with secure, rotating tokens
- Principle of least privilege for all system access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest:** AES-256 for stored data
- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Token Security:** Plaid tokens encrypted, never exposed to clients
- **Key Management:** Secure key storage with rotation schedule

#### Application Security
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

#### Infrastructure Security
- Firewall rules limiting network access
- Regular security patches and updates
- Containerized deployment with minimal attack surface
- Secrets management (environment variables, not code)

### 5.2 Operational Controls

#### Secure Development Lifecycle
1. Security requirements in design phase
2. Secure coding training for developers
3. Code review with security checklist
4. Automated security testing in CI/CD
5. Security sign-off before deployment

#### Change Management
- All changes tracked in version control
- Code review required for all merges
- Staging environment testing before production
- Rollback procedures documented

#### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection:** Automated alerting on anomalies
2. **Triage:** Assess severity and impact
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication:** Remove threat
5. **Recovery:** Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident review

### 5.3 Administrative Controls

- Background checks for personnel with data access
- Security awareness training
- Acceptable use policy
- Data classification guidelines
- Vendor security requirements

---

## 6. Security Monitoring

### 6.1 Continuous Monitoring

| Monitoring Type | Frequency | Tool/Method |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Application logs | Real-time | Centralized logging |
| Error rates | Real-time | Application monitoring |
| API usage patterns | Real-time | Rate limiting & analytics |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | Daily | Automated scanning |
| Access logs | Real-time | Authentication service |
| Infrastructure health | Real-time | Health checks |

### 6.2 Security Metrics

Key security indicators tracked:

- Number of security vulnerabilities (by severity)
- Mean time to remediate vulnerabilities
- Failed authentication attempts
- API error rates and anomalies
- Dependency update currency
- Security training completion rate

### 6.3 Alerting Thresholds

| Event | Threshold | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Failed logins | 5 in 5 minutes | Account lockout, alert |
| API errors | 10% increase | Investigate immediately |
| New critical CVE | Any | Patch within 24 hours |
| Unusual data access | Anomaly detected | Review and investigate |

---

## 7. Plaid-Specific Security Controls

### 7.1 Token Management

- Access tokens stored encrypted in database
- Tokens never logged or exposed in error messages
- Token refresh handled server-side only
- Immediate revocation on user disconnect

### 7.2 API Security

- All Plaid API calls authenticated with client credentials
- Webhook signature verification enabled
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request/response logging (excluding sensitive data)

### 7.3 Data Handling

- Financial data accessed on-demand, not bulk stored
- Transaction data retention limited to 24 months
- No storage of bank credentials (handled by Plaid)
- Data minimization: only collect what's needed

---

## 8. Compliance

### 8.1 Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:

- **SOC 2 Type II** principles (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
- **CCPA** requirements for personal data protection
- **PCI DSS** guidance for handling financial data
- **OWASP Top 10** application security standards

### 8.2 Audit Trail

All security-relevant events are logged:

- Authentication events (success/failure)
- Authorization decisions
- Data access events
- Administrative actions
- Security configuration changes

Logs retained for 12 months minimum.

---

## 9. Exception Handling

Security policy exceptions require:

1. Written justification
2. Risk assessment
3. Compensating controls identified
4. Time-bound approval (max 90 days)
5. Documented in exception registry

---

## 10. Policy Enforcement

- Violations investigated promptly
- Remediation required within defined SLAs
- Repeat violations escalated
