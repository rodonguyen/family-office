## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the access control framework for Finance Guru to ensure that access to production assets, sensitive data, and system resources is appropriately restricted based on business need and the principle of least privilege.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All production systems and environments
- Development and staging environments
- User financial data accessed through Plaid integration
- API keys, tokens, and credentials
- Administrative interfaces and dashboards
- Source code repositories
- Cloud infrastructure and services

---

## 3. Access Control Principles

### 3.1 Principle of Least Privilege

All access is granted based on the minimum permissions necessary to perform job functions:

- Users receive only the access required for their specific role
- Access is not granted "just in case" or for convenience
- Elevated privileges are time-limited and logged
- Default access level is "no access"

### 3.2 Separation of Duties

Critical functions are divided among different individuals:

| Function | Separation Requirement |
|----------|----------------------|
| Code deployment | Separate from code authoring |
| Access provisioning | Separate from access approval |
| Database administration | Separate from application development |
| Security monitoring | Separate from system administration |

### 3.3 Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of access control are implemented:

- Network-level controls (firewalls, VPNs)
- Application-level authentication
- Data-level encryption and access restrictions
- Physical access controls where applicable

---

## 4. Identity Management

### 4.1 Account Types

| Account Type | Purpose | Controls |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| User Accounts | Individual access | Unique per person, MFA required |
| Service Accounts | Application-to-application | No interactive login, rotated credentials |
| Administrative Accounts | System administration | Separate from daily-use accounts, enhanced logging |
| Emergency Accounts | Break-glass access | Sealed credentials, audit trail required |

### 4.2 Account Lifecycle

**Provisioning:**
1. Access request submitted with business justification
2. Manager approval required
3. Security review for privileged access
4. Account created with minimum necessary permissions
5. User acknowledges acceptable use policy

**Modification:**
1. Role change triggers access review
2. New permissions require approval
3. Unnecessary permissions removed promptly

**Deprovisioning:**
1. Access revoked within 24 hours of termination
2. All sessions terminated immediately
3. Credentials rotated for shared resources
4. Access removal logged and verified

---

## 5. Authentication Requirements

### 5.1 Password Policy

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Minimum length | 12 characters |
| Complexity | Upper, lower, number, special character |
| Expiration | 90 days for privileged accounts |
| History | Cannot reuse last 12 passwords |
| Lockout | 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout |

### 5.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is required for:

- All production system access
- Administrative interfaces
- Cloud service consoles (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- Source code repositories
- VPN connections
- Access to financial data

Approved MFA methods:
- Hardware security keys (preferred)
- Authenticator applications (TOTP)
- Push notifications from approved apps

### 5.3 Session Management

- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Re-authentication required for sensitive operations
- Concurrent session limits enforced
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure and non-predictable

---

## 6. Authorization Framework

### 6.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access is granted through predefined roles:

| Role | Access Level | Permissions |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Developer | Development environments | Code read/write, staging deploy |
| Operations | Production systems | Deploy, monitor, incident response |
| Administrator | Infrastructure | Full system access, user management |
| Auditor | Read-only | Logs, reports, compliance data |
| Support | Limited production | User assistance, read-only data access |

### 6.2 Data Classification and Access

| Data Classification | Access Requirements |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Public | No restrictions |
| Internal | Authenticated users |
| Confidential | Role-based, need-to-know |
| Restricted (Financial Data) | Explicit authorization, MFA, audit logging |

### 6.3 API Access Control

- All API endpoints require authentication
- API keys are environment-specific (dev/staging/prod)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- API access logged with request details
- Plaid tokens encrypted and never exposed to clients

---

## 7. Production Environment Controls

### 7.1 Access Restrictions

Production environment access is limited to:

- Authorized operations personnel
- On-call engineers during incidents
- Automated deployment systems

**Prohibited in Production:**

- Sharing of production access credentials

### 7.2 Change Management

All production changes require:

2. Peer review and approval
3. Testing in staging environment
4. Rollback plan documented
5. Post-deployment verification

### 7.3 Emergency Access

Break-glass procedures for emergencies:

1. Emergency access requested with incident reference
2. Access granted for limited duration (max 4 hours)
3. All actions logged and monitored
4. Post-incident review required within 24 hours
5. Access automatically revoked at expiration

---

## 8. Third-Party Access

### 8.1 Vendor Access Requirements

Third-party access to systems requires:

- Signed confidentiality agreement
- Security assessment completed
- Access limited to specific systems and timeframes
- Activity monitoring and logging
- Regular access review

### 8.2 Plaid Integration Security

- Plaid API credentials stored in secure secrets manager
- Access to Plaid dashboard limited to authorized personnel
- Webhook endpoints authenticated with signature verification
- No storage of end-user banking credentials

---

## 9. Physical Access Controls

### 9.1 Data Center Security

Cloud infrastructure providers (AWS/GCP) maintain:

- 24/7 physical security
- Biometric access controls
- Video surveillance
- Visitor logging and escort requirements

### 9.2 Endpoint Security

Devices accessing production systems must have:

- Full disk encryption enabled
- Endpoint protection software
- Automatic screen lock (5 minutes)
- Remote wipe capability
