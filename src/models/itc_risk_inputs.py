ITC Risk Models Pydantic Models for Finance Guru™

This module defines type-safe data structures for ITC (Into The Cryptoverse)
Risk API integration.

ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
These models represent Layer 1 of our 3-layer architecture:
    Layer 1: Pydantic Models (THIS FILE) - Data validation
    Layer 2: Calculator Classes - Business logic (src/analysis/itc_risk.py)
    Layer 3: CLI Interface - Agent integration (src/analysis/itc_risk_cli.py)

EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:
- ITC Risk provides market-implied risk scores (0-1) based on price action
- Risk bands show how risk changes at different price levels
- This complements our internal VaR/Sharpe metrics with external perspective
- Think of ITC as a "second opinion" on risk from market sentiment

SUPPORTED TICKERS:
    TradFi: TSLA, AAPL, MSTR, NFLX, SP500, DXY, XAUUSD, XAGUSD, XPDUSD, PL, HG, NICKEL
    Crypto: BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, DOGE, LINK, and 21 others

    WHAT: Maps a price level to its corresponding risk score

    EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
    Risk bands help answer: "If the price moves to $X, what's the risk?"
    - Low prices often have low risk scores (buying dips is lower risk)
    - High prices often have high risk scores (buying near ATH is higher risk)
    - But this varies by asset and market conditions!

    USAGE EXAMPLE:
        band = RiskBand(price=450.15, risk_score=0.489)
