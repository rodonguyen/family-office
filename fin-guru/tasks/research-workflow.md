## Step-by-Step Task Instructions

### Phase 0: Temporal Context Initialization (MANDATORY - 1 minute)

⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This phase is MANDATORY and BLOCKING. All subsequent research activities are PROHIBITED until temporal context is successfully established.

#### Step 0.1: Execute Temporal Awareness Protocol

**Purpose**: Establish current date context to ensure all research includes appropriate temporal qualifiers, preventing retrieval of outdated information that could lead to poor investment decisions.

**Execution**:

```bash
# Get full current datetime with month, day, year
date

# Get structured date for documentation
date +"%Y-%m-%d"
```

**Store Results**:
- `{current_datetime}` = Full datetime (e.g., "Sun Oct 12 23:53:51 CDT 2025")
- `{current_date}` = Structured date (e.g., "2025-10-12")

**Validation Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Full datetime successfully retrieved and stored as {current_datetime}
- [ ] Structured date successfully retrieved and stored as {current_date}
- [ ] Datetime includes month, day, and year
- [ ] Structured date format verified as YYYY-MM-DD

**On Failure**: If temporal context cannot be established, STOP ALL RESEARCH ACTIVITY and report error to user. Do not proceed to Phase 1.

#### Step 0.2: Establish Search Enhancement Protocol

**Search Query Enhancement Rules** (MANDATORY):

All web searches conducted in this workflow MUST include temporal qualifiers. Non-compliant searches are PROHIBITED.

**Temporal Qualifier Requirements**:
1. Include month and year from `{current_datetime}` (e.g., "October 2025"), OR
2. Include "latest" keyword, OR
3. Include "current" keyword

**Examples** (using current datetime: Sun Oct 12 23:53:51 CDT 2025):

✅ **COMPLIANT QUERIES**:
- "Tesla stock analysis October 2025 latest"
- "Federal Reserve policy October 2025"
- "Current S&P 500 valuation metrics"
- "Latest GDP growth data United States 2025"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT QUERIES** (DO NOT USE):
- "Tesla stock analysis"
- "Federal Reserve policy"
- "S&P 500 valuation metrics"
- "GDP growth data"

#### Step 0.3: Define Data Freshness Requirements

**Freshness Thresholds by Data Type**:

| Data Type | Maximum Age | Validation Action |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Market Data (prices, quotes) | Same-day | REJECT if older |
| Economic Indicators | 30 days | FLAG if older |
| Regulatory Changes | 90 days | FLAG if older |
| Company Financials | Current quarter | FLAG if outdated |
| Analyst Ratings | 30 days | FLAG if older |

**Source Validation Protocol**:
- Every source MUST be timestamped with collection date
- Compare source date against freshness requirements
- Flag or reject sources exceeding age thresholds
- Document any freshness violations in research report

**Quality Gate**:
- [ ] Freshness thresholds understood and documented
- [ ] Source validation protocol ready for implementation
- [ ] Timestamp documentation system prepared

**Completion Confirmation**:

Display confirmation message before proceeding:

```
✅ TEMPORAL AWARENESS CONFIRMED

Current DateTime: {current_datetime}
Structured Date: {current_date}

📋 Search Enhancement Rules Active:
• All queries MUST include month/year (e.g., "October 2025"), "latest", or "current"
• Market data: Same-day only
• Economic data: Within 30 days
• Regulatory data: Within 90 days

Proceeding to Phase 1: Research Planning and Scoping
