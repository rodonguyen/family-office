Test suite for Cash Flow Section

Tests the TypeScript cash-flow.ts section implementation via subprocess.
This validates:
- Section initialization
- Input validation (currency, positive values)
- Investment capacity validation (cannot exceed income)
- Data structure correctness
- State persistence
